Through a massive open online course on Coursera, over 70 participants from over 25 countries identify and annotate 2,460 single-gene perturbation signatures, 839 disease versus normal signatures, and 906 drug perturbation signatures. All these signatures are unique and are manually validated for quality. Global analysis of these signatures confirms known associations and identifies novel associations between genes, diseases and drugs. The manually curated signatures are used as a training set to develop classifiers for extracting similar signatures from the entire GEO repository.",

L1000FWD enables coloring of signatures by different attributes such as cell type, time point, concentration, as well as drug attributes such as MOA and clinical phase. Each point on the L1000FWD interactive map is linked to a signature landing page, which provides multifaceted knowledge from various sources about the signature and the drug. Notably such information includes most frequent diagnoses, co-prescribed drugs and age distribution of prescriptions as extracted from the Mount Sinai Health System electronic medical records. Overall, L1000FWD serves as a platform for identifying functions for novel small molecules using unsupervised clustering, as well as for exploring drug MOA.",

We present a deep learning model that uses vital signs and lab tests contained within the EMR of Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) to predict chronological age. The model is trained on 377,686 EMR from patients of ages 18–85 years old. The discrepancy between the predicted and real chronological age is then used as a proxy to estimate physiological age. Overall, the model can predict the chronological age of patients with a standard deviation error of ∼7 years. The patients predicted to be significantly older than their chronological age have higher systolic blood pressure, higher cholesterol, damaged liver, and anemia. In contrast, patients predicted to be younger than their chronological age have lower blood pressure and shorter stature among other indicators.",

The most predictive biological-term features can assist in understanding the drug mechanisms of action. Finally, we applied the classifier to all >20,000 small molecules profiled, and developed a web portal for browsing and searching predictive small-molecule/ADR connections.",
